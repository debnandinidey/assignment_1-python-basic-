The resulting expression is not evaluated immediately, but instead, it creates an iterator that can be used to generate the elements on-demand."

    "iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It provides a way to access elements of a container or a sequence one at a time without needing to store them all in memory at once. Iterators have two essential methods: __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next element from the iterator. When there are no more elements, it raises the StopIteration exception.\n",

When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over. Each time the generator's __next__() method is called, the function's execution is resumed from where it left off until it encounters a yield statement. \n"

List comprehensions also directly return a new list, while map calls return an iterator that needs to be converted to a list if desired."
